# Dataverse Powertools

Dataverse Powertools contains tools and templates to assist with the development of Dataverse and Dynamics 365 projects. It enables developers to perform various actions such as:

* Extract Solutions to source control and build and release them using Azure DevOps Pipelines
* Creating, updating, and deploying web resources with TypeScript
* Creating and managing custom C# plugins and PCF fields and datasets
* Creating and managing Portal assets such as templates and web pages
* Generating and updating Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and more
* Testing code and test cases on Dynamics forms directly in vs code before deployment

It provides a user-friendly interface in the Visual Studio Code editor, allowing developers to perform all these actions without leaving the development environment. The tool provides a range of templates, snippets, and other resources to help developers speed up their development process.

In summary, this tool is an all-in-one solution that streamlines the development process and helps developers to efficiently build and manage Dynamics 365 and Power Platform solutions in Visual Studio Code.
