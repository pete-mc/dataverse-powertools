## 0.1.10

- Added Earlybound Table and Action GUI to the Dataverse PowerTools menu.  This will allow you to select the tables and actions for spkl to generate into classes from the menu rather than editing the spkl.json manually.  This release includes the ability to select any available table from your dataverse environment, future releases will also allow this for actions. Currently action selection is limited to using the manual + button.
